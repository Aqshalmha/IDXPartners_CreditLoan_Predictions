# IDXPartners_CreditLoan_Predictions

##Problem Statement:
Credit risk is a risk that must be borne by a lending institution to an individual or agency whose own risk is the non-payment of principal and interest on the loan, resulting in various kinds of losses, such as disruption of cash flow for lenders and increasing collection costs.

One of the causes of this is the inappropriate determination of prospective creditors, causing potential creditors who have the potential to be accepted to be disqualified while providing loans to problematic creditors.

To minimize existing credit risk, a risk assessment process can be carried out before being given a loan which can be called credit scoring and credit rating on the borrower.

##Goal:
can minimize the risks that can occur to borrowing institutions, and can create speed and efficiency to predict and assess optimal credit applications, where this prediction determines whether the loan application is accepted or rejected by the lending institution.

In addition, it can facilitate cash flow from borrowing companies and make the assets of the company definitely increase.

##Objective:
Create predictive model to determine good client and bad client.
